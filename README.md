My college's course project for android. The idea was to make application that improves your sleep(set alarms, write dreams, get information). It's my first experience using kotlin and jetpack compose. Code is pretty terrible. In my defense I can say that with a time limit, gigantic plans(for my level) and almost no experience, result is not that bad. I even drawn a design in figma for it.
